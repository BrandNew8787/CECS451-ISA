        "\n",
        "Selection: Starting at the root node, traverse the tree by selecting the child node with the highest Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) value until you reach a leaf node. The UCB value is calculated as a combination of the node's expected reward and the exploration term.\n",
        "\n",
        "Expansion: Once you reach a leaf node, expand it by adding child nodes for all possible actions from that state.\n",
        "\n",
        "Simulation: Perform a simulation (also known as a rollout) by randomly selecting actions from the expanded node until a terminal state is reached. The resulting reward is used as an estimate of the value of the leaf node.\n",
        "\n",
        "Backpropagation: Propagate the reward obtained in the simulation up the tree to update the expected reward and visit count for each node that was visited during the selection phase.\n",
        "\n",
        "Repeat steps 2-5 for a fixed number of iterations or until a termination criterion is met.\n",
